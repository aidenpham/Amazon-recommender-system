# Amazon-recommender-system
These 2 datasets are taken from https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
They are related to products in the Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry category on Amazon website. The 1st dataframe (meta) includes information of 23033 products and the 2nd (reviews) includes 278677 reviews of those products from 2003 to 2014. Only products and users with at least 5 reviews are included.

In this project, I will build a recommender system based on the reviews dataset.
